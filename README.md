## CLOCK Token (Current Time)

**So absolutely no one asked for this but here it is: A token that tells the time using its balance.**

 Now you don't have to glance at the corner of your screen to tell what time it is, just look at your wallet.
(No tx required, just manually add ethereum token _0x5A64ebDF825d3a33b09daA53921421cdF09E2c22_ to your wallet).

Every address has the current UTC time as a balance. You can also adjust the timezone with the _offsetHours()_ and _offsetMinutes()_ functions if needed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a64ebdf825d3a33b09daa53921421cdf09e2c22#writeContract
